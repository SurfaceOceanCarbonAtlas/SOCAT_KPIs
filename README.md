# SOCAT_KPIs
KPIs generated from SOCAT data for various purposes. Documentation to be written.

## Notes
The notebook `import_regions.ipynb` expects a folder named `shapes` with various files in it.
Uncertainties around licensing mean that this folder is not included in the repository yet.
Contact @squaregoldfish for a copy.

The intention is to develop code to download the source data and generate the shape files
on demand.
